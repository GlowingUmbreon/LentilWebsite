# Background
Goldren Triangle Community Support aimed to ensure that their organization prioritized Cyber Security and possessed the necessary credentials to validate this commitment. Galactic IT played a crucial role in facilitating this process and guided them through the Cyber Essentials + Certification.

# Challenge
As a charity, Goldren Triangle Community Support heavily depends on frontline volunteers and donations. Any proposed solution needed to be user-friendly and cost-effective.

# Solution
Our approach for Goldren Triangle Community Support commenced with a thorough risk assessment and gap analysis. This audit identified areas for improvement, which we subsequently communicated to our client. We implemented the following solutions:
* **Replaced Outdated Devices**: Identified outdated endpoints were upgraded or replaced to ensure they operated on the latest supported Operating System.
* **Updated Devices**: Devices were located and updated, with automatic update policies established to ensure devices auto-update upon startup and check for updates at regular intervals.
* **Malware Prevention**: Policies were implemented to ensure that any email attachments are scanned before users can access them.
* **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Ensured that all internal and external websites and applications handling user creation and data have Multi-Factor Authentication in place.

# Outcome
Goldren Triangle Community Support successfully passed their Cyber Essentials + Audit and received certification. This achievement has enabled them to meet tender requirements and, importantly, demonstrate to their service users that the data they handle is processed securely.
